                                Welcome to the Colorado Art Rock Society (C.A.R.S.), where the last Saturday 
                                evening of the month transforms into a haven for music aficionados and 
                                progressive rock enthusiasts alike.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Our journey began humbly on March 27th, 1999, with just four passionate 
                                individuals coming together to share their love for this genre. 
                                Fast forward to today, and our community continues to flourish, 
                                reflecting our shared passion for the unconventional, the experimental, 
                                and the groundbreaking.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In addition to our monthly gatherings, we've twice hosted the 
                                Flower Kings and we continue to organize our annual 
                                <span>Progfest</span>, first held on April 26th, 2003, 
                                where members get a chance to play “all of the Prog Songs 
                                they ever wanted to play in a band but were afraid to ask.”
                            </p> 
                            <p>
                                At the heart of C.A.R.S. lies our mission: to cultivate a vibrant 
                                ecosystem where the exploration, dialogue, and appreciation of 
                                progressive rock thrive. We're more than just a society; we're 
                                a community bound by a common love for music that transcends 
                                boundaries and defies expectations.

                            <h3>The Myth</h3>
                            <p>
                                The Colorado Art Rock Society was founded 
                                on March 12, 1999 by Phil Satterley and Alan Mallery. While waiting 
                                in line to see a Yes concert, Alan noticed Phil leafing through a 
                                copy of Paramhansa Yoganada's Autobiography of a Yogi. Phil was 
                                caught up in a footnote on page 92 that described a secret society 
                                of music lovers who only listen to music in odd meters.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                After the show, Alan followed Phil back 
                                to his house where the two of them began holding sessions by 
                                candlelight. The concept came together during one 6-hour session 
                                which carried on until 7:00am. They had listened to Van Der Graaf 
                                Generator's entire back catalog. It was a magical experience that 
                                left both of them exhilarated for days. They both agreed that 
                                there was only one course of action and that was to form a music
                                society for like minded and intelligent odd-metered music 
                                connoisseurs, The Colorado Art Rock Society.

                            <h4>A Note From Phil...</h4>
                            <p>
                                The Colorado Art Rock Society (C.A.R.S.) 
                                was formed in 1999 when Phil Satterley had a chance meeting with 
                                Alan and Carrie Mallery at the Bajaprog '99 Festival in Mexicali, 
                                Mexico (surprisingly the first people Phil even talked to after 
                                arriving in Mexico were also from Colorado!) The first meeting 
                                was on March 27, 1999 when C.A.R.S. met at the Margarita Bay Club 
                                in Denver Colorado. With just 4 members at that meeting C.A.R.S. 
                                was born. Suddenly the numbers grew and after reaching over 15, 
                                C.A.R.S. moved out of the smaller back meeting room and was 
                                forced to take over the entire upstairs until December 29, 2001 
                                when the restaurant closed and the group moved to it's second location 
                                at the Morrison Inn in Golden Colorado (actually just down the 
                                street from the famed Red Rocks Amphitheater).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The group met there as the numbers 
                                grew and so did the noise level! The tiled floors and high 
                                ceilings made it quite difficult to hear the music, let alone 
                                hear each other! Finally it was decided to move. Our next 
                                location was the Yummy Yummy Thai restaurant on October 25, 2003 
                                and the C.A.R.S. holiday party on December 13th. It was decided 
                                once again to move because of space issues and belly dancers?!?!?! 
                                and it was off to the Breckenridge Brew Pub where we met until approximately 2016. The 
                                space was the right size, with a closed off meeting area as well 
                                as being perfect for listening to music or setting up 
                                a wide screen projector for watching prog videos.
